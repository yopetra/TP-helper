# TP-helper

## Poject overview

This app is a teleprompter, which show scrolling text while people making some video. Its help to make content more better, because you can prepare whole text and then easy read it from the screen.
App has such functionality as: 
- Changing size of the text
- Change text and background colors from predefined list
- Swipe the screen if you will use a prism at from of the cam
- Change scrolling speed

## What I've learned?

Used custom items swipe, when delete an item from the list. I thought that this functionality is a standard thing, but I was wrong. To implement such functionality I've found some example of the come, which I've implemented in the project.
Scrolling text were not a standard functionality too. To implement it I've used library which I modified to realise all functionality that I needed.
